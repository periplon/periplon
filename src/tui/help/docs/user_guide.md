### Method 3: Import

1. Place YAML files in your workflows directory
2. The TUI auto-discovers them
3. Open and edit as needed

## Editing Workflows

### Text Mode (Default)

Direct YAML editing with syntax highlighting:

```yaml
name: "My Workflow"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "What this workflow does"

agents:
  researcher:
    description: "Research and analyze"
    tools: [Read, Write, WebSearch]

tasks:
  analyze:
    description: "Analyze the data"
    agent: "researcher"
```

**Editing Tips:**
- Use 2-space indentation
- Quote strings with special characters
- Use lists for tools and dependencies
- Add descriptions for clarity

### Form Mode

Toggle with `Tab` for structured editing:
- Field-by-field input
- Auto-validation
- Reduced syntax errors
- Guided workflow creation

### Real-Time Validation

The editor validates as you type:

‚úì **Valid YAML syntax**
‚úì **Required fields present**
‚úì **Agent references exist**
‚úì **No circular dependencies**
‚úì **Valid tool names**

Errors appear inline with:
- Line number
- Error description
- Suggested fix (when available)

### Auto-Completion

Press `Ctrl+Space` for suggestions:
- Workflow field names
- Agent properties
- Tool names
- Task attributes
- Variable references

## Executing Workflows

### Starting Execution

1. Select a workflow in the list
2. Press `x` to execute
3. Execution monitor opens automatically

### Monitoring Progress

The execution monitor shows:

1. **Task Graph**: Visual dependency tree
2. **Task Status**: Current state of all tasks
   - üîµ Pending
   - üü° Running
   - üü¢ Completed
   - üî¥ Failed
   - ‚ö™ Skipped
3. **Logs**: Real-time output from agents
4. **Progress**: Overall completion percentage

### Execution Controls

Example filters:
- `task:analyze` - Only logs from "analyze" task
- `level:error` - Only error messages
- `agent:researcher` - Only from "researcher" agent

## Tips & Tricks

### Workflow Management

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Make workflows easy to identify
2. **Add Descriptions**: Help future you understand the purpose
3. **Version Your Workflows**: Use semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.1.0, etc.)
4. **Organize by Purpose**: Use prefixes like "prod-", "test-", "dev-"

### Editing Efficiency

1. **Validate Often**: Press `Ctrl+V` regularly
2. **Use Form Mode**: Toggle with `Tab` for complex workflows
3. **Leverage Auto-Complete**: `Ctrl+Space` saves time
4. **Save Frequently**: `Ctrl+S` after major changes
5. **Use Undo/Redo**: Don't be afraid to experiment

### Search Power

1. **Use `/` Everywhere**: Quick way to find what you need
2. **Partial Matches**: Type first few letters
3. **Filter by Tags**: Add keywords to workflows for easy searching
4. **Recent Items**: Most recently modified appear at top

### Execution Monitoring

1. **Use Follow Mode**: Press `f` to auto-scroll logs
2. **Filter Noise**: Use `/` to focus on relevant logs
3. **Check Task Graph**: Understand dependencies visually
4. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Watch for performance issues

### AI Generation

1. **Be Specific**: Detailed prompts generate better workflows
2. **Iterate**: Generate, review, edit, regenerate
3. **Learn from Examples**: Study generated YAML structure
4. **Customize After**: Always review and customize generated workflows

### Troubleshooting

**Problem: Validation errors**
- Solution: Read inline error messages carefully
- Check YAML indentation (use 2 spaces)
- Verify agent and task names match

**Problem: Execution fails**
- Solution: Check execution monitor logs
- Verify agent permissions
- Review task dependencies

**Problem: TUI not rendering correctly**
- Solution: Ensure terminal supports Unicode
- Try resizing terminal window
- Check color settings

**Problem: Search not finding workflows**
- Solution: Check search query spelling
- Try broader search terms
- Verify workflows have content to search

## Advanced Features

### Variable Interpolation

Use variables in workflows:

```yaml
inputs:
  project_name:
    type: string
    required: true

tasks:
  analyze:
    description: "Analyze ${workflow.project_name}"
```

Scopes:
- `${workflow.var}`: Workflow-level
- `${agent.var}`: Agent-level
- `${task.var}`: Task-level

### Task Dependencies

Create workflows with complex dependencies:

```yaml
tasks:
  fetch:
    description: "Fetch data"
    agent: "fetcher"

  process:
    description: "Process data"
    agent: "processor"
    depends_on: [fetch]

  report:
    description: "Generate report"
    agent: "reporter"
    depends_on: [process]
```

### Hierarchical Tasks

Break down complex tasks:

```yaml
tasks:
  analyze:
    description: "Main analysis"
    agent: "analyzer"
    subtasks:
      - analyze_code
      - analyze_docs
      - generate_summary
```
