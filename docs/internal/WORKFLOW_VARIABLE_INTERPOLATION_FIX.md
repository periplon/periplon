# Workflow Variable Interpolation Fix

## Issue Summary

The workflow was not actually "failing" - it was working correctly. The issue was **cosmetic**: task descriptions with variable references like `${workflow.output_dir}` were displayed in the console output without interpolation, making it appear as if variables weren't being resolved.

## Root Cause

In `src/dsl/executor.rs` at line 1002, the task description was printed to console **before** variable interpolation occurred:

```rust
println!("Executing task: {} - {}", task_id, spec.description);
```

Variable interpolation happened later in the execution flow (around line 1081), so the actual task execution used properly interpolated values, but the console output showed the raw template strings.

## Evidence That Workflow Was Actually Working

1. **Script execution**: Variables were correctly interpolated in script content
2. **Definition of Done checks**: DoD criteria properly interpolated paths and patterns
3. **File creation**: Output files were created in the correct directories (e.g., `./output/` not `${workflow.output_dir}/`)

### Test Demonstration

Created a simple test workflow (`test_simple_workflow.yaml`) that:
- Defined `output_dir` input variable with default `./test_output`
- Used `${workflow.output_dir}` in task description, script, and DoD criteria
- Successfully created the directory and files with interpolated paths

**Before fix** - Console output:
```
Executing task: test_variables - Test variable interpolation in ${workflow.output_dir}
```

**After fix** - Console output:
```
Executing task: test_variables - Test variable interpolation in ./test_output
```

But the actual execution was correct in both cases!

## The Fix

Modified `src/dsl/executor.rs` (execute_task_static function) to interpolate variables before printing the task description:

### Before (line ~1002):
```rust
println!("Executing task: {} - {}", task_id, spec.description);
```

### After (lines 1002-1013):
```rust
// Create variable context for displaying task description
let mut var_context_for_display = crate::dsl::variables::VariableContext::new();
for (key, value) in workflow_inputs.iter() {
    var_context_for_display.insert(&crate::dsl::variables::Scope::Workflow, key, value.clone());
}

// Interpolate task description for display
let display_description = var_context_for_display
    .interpolate(&spec.description)
    .unwrap_or_else(|_| spec.description.clone());

println!("Executing task: {} - {}", task_id, display_description);
```

## What Was Already Working

The following components were already correctly interpolating variables:

1. **Task execution** (line ~1081): Task description sent to agents
2. **Script content** (line ~1400): `substitute_variables` in `execute_script_task`
3. **Command execution** (line ~1496): `substitute_variables` in `execute_command_task`
4. **DoD criteria** (line ~1884): `var_context.interpolate()` in `check_criterion`:
   - `FileExists` paths
   - `FileContains` paths and patterns
   - `CommandSucceeds` commands and arguments
   - `DirectoryExists` paths
   - All other criterion types
5. **Script file paths** (line ~1383)
6. **Working directories** (line ~1410)
7. **Environment variables** (line ~1417)

## Impact

- **Before**: Users saw uninterpolated variable references in console output and assumed the workflow wasn't working
- **After**: Console output shows properly interpolated values, making it clear that variables are being resolved
- **Functionality**: No change to actual workflow execution - it was already working correctly

## Testing

### Simple Test (Verified Working)
```bash
./target/release/dsl-executor run test_simple_workflow.yaml
```

Output now shows:
```
Executing task: test_variables - Test variable interpolation in ./test_output
```

### Original Workflow (Verified Working)
```bash
./target/release/dsl-executor run test_failing_workflow.yaml
```

Output now shows:
```
Executing task: initialize - Initialize project structure and output directory at ./output
```

## Files Modified

- `src/dsl/executor.rs`: Added variable interpolation before printing task description (lines 1002-1013)

## Files Created for Testing

- `test_simple_workflow.yaml`: Minimal test demonstrating variable interpolation
- `test_failing_workflow.yaml`: Original user workflow (validated and working)
- `test_workflow_validation.yaml`: Corrected example workflow with proper structure

## Related Documentation

See `DSL_STRUCTURE_FIXES.md` for information about:
- Correct output structure (`source` must be object with `type` field)
- Correct notification structure (channels must be inline, not named references)

## Conclusion

The workflow was **never actually failing**. Variables were always being interpolated correctly in:
- Script execution
- Command execution
- Definition of Done checks
- File paths and working directories

The only issue was that the console output didn't show interpolated values, creating confusion. This has now been fixed for better user experience.
