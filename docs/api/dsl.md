plan a simple to read and write DSL (Domain-Specific Language) to create agentic AI systems using the functionalities of this SDK. The agents should be able to accomplish complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller sub-tasks, utilizing tools, and collaborating with other agents when necessary. Write the plan in dsl-plan.md. The DSL should include constructs for defining agents, tasks, tools, and communication protocols between agents. Ensure that the DSL is intuitive and easy to use for end users with varying levels of expertise in AI and programming. It should be powerful enough to handle a wide range of applications, from simple automation to complex problem-solving scenarios. Provide examples of how to use the DSL to create different types of agents and workflows.
